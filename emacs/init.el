;;; medicated.el --- Medicated Emacs, a minimal and modern Emacs configuration
;;; https://github.com/RolandMarchand/medicated-emacs
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A lightweight, opinionated Emacs starter configuration that provides
;; modern conveniences while staying true to standard Emacs patterns.
;;
;; PHILOSOPHY:
;;
;; This config enhances Emacs without hiding it. Everything uses standard
;; Emacs patterns and conventions. If you know how to customize vanilla
;; Emacs, you know how to customize this config - there are no frameworks,
;; wrappers, or special systems to learn.
;;
;; The goal is to provide a good starting point with:
;; - Modern completion (Vertico + Orderless + Marginalia)
;; - LSP support via Eglot (built-in)
;; - Git integration (Magit + diff-hl)
;; - Quality-of-life improvements (better defaults, recent files, etc.)
;; - Common language modes pre-installed
;;
;; REQUIREMENTS:
;;
;; - Emacs 29.0 or later
;; - Internet connection (for first-time package installation)
;; - LSP servers installed separately if you want LSP features
;;   (e.g., clangd for C/C++, rust-analyzer for Rust, etc.)
;;
;; INSTALLATION:
;;
;; 1. Ensure you have an empty Emacs configuration directory, or none at all.
;;    Your Emacs config directory is typically one of:
;;    - ~/.emacs.d/
;;    - ~/.config/emacs/
;;
;;    If these exist and contain files, back them up and delete them,
;;    or Emacs may load conflicting configurations.
;;
;; 2. Place this file as "init.el" in one of these locations:
;;    - ~/.emacs.d/init.el (traditional location, always checked first)
;;    - ~/.config/emacs/init.el (XDG-compliant location)
;;
;;    Note: Emacs prefers ~/.emacs.d/ if it exists. To use the XDG location,
;;    ensure ~/.emacs.d/ does not exist.
;;
;; 3. Launch Emacs. On first run:
;;    - All packages will be automatically downloaded and installed
;;    - A message will appear: "First-time setup complete. Please restart Emacs."
;;    - Emacs will automatically close after 10 seconds
;;
;; 4. Restart Emacs. Your configuration is now ready to use.
;;
;; TROUBLESHOOTING:
;;
;; If the configuration doesn't work after restarting:
;; 1. Delete ALL files (including hidden files) in your Emacs directory
;; 2. Try the installation process again
;; 3. If problems persist, file a bug report with details about your
;;    Emacs version, operating system, and the exact error messages
;;
;; LEARNING EMACS:
;;
;; If you're new to Emacs, start with the built-in tutorial:
;;   M-x help-with-tutorial RET
;; (That's: Alt+x, type "help-with-tutorial", press Enter)
;;
;; Learn Emacs as you would with vanilla Emacs - this config doesn't
;; change fundamental Emacs concepts or introduce special systems.
;; Standard Emacs documentation and resources apply directly.
;;
;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;;
;; Don't like something? Change it as you would in vanilla Emacs:
;; - Theme: M-x customize-themes or edit 'custom-enabled-themes
;; - Font: M-x customize-face default or set in 'default-frame-alist
;; - Keybindings: Use global-set-key or local-set-key
;; - Any setting: M-x customize-variable or edit custom-set-variables
;;
;; This config does nothing special - it's just Emacs with better defaults.
;;
;; EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
;;
;; All behavior (both functional and errors) from this config represents
;; the normal Emacs experience, or bugs in the included third-party packages.
;;
;; EGLOT (LSP) NOTES:
;;
;; Eglot (the built-in LSP client) is enabled by default in all programming
;; modes via prog-mode-hook. This is the most common source of errors because:
;;
;; - Eglot expects LSP servers to be already installed on your system
;; - If a language server is missing, Eglot will show error messages
;; - Different languages need different LSP servers:
;;   * C/C++: clangd
;;   * Rust: rust-analyzer  
;;   * Python: pyright or pylsp
;;   * Go: gopls
;;   * JavaScript/TypeScript: typescript-language-server
;;   * Lua: lua-language-server
;;   And so on...
;;
;; If Eglot causes issues, you can:
;; 1. Remove 'eglot-ensure from prog-mode-hook in custom-set-variables
;; 2. Add it to specific language mode hooks instead:
;;    (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
;; 3. Or disable it entirely and use Emacs without LSP
;;
;; PACKAGE LIST:
;;
;; This config installs these third-party packages:
;; - csv-mode: CSV file editing
;; - diff-hl: Git diff indicators in the fringe
;; - doom-modeline: Modern mode-line
;; - doom-themes: Collection of themes (Gruvbox used by default)
;; - go-mode: Go language support
;; - helpful: Better help buffers
;; - json-mode: JSON highlight support
;; - lua-mode: Lua language support
;; - magit: Git interface
;; - marginalia: Completion annotations
;; - markdown-mode: Markdown editing
;; - orderless: Fuzzy completion matching
;; - rainbow-delimiters: Colored parentheses by depth
;; - rust-mode: Rust language support
;; - typescript-mode: TypeScript language support
;; - vertico: Vertical completion UI
;; - which key: Displays possible key bindings
;; - yaml-mode: YAML file editing
;;
;;; Code:

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
